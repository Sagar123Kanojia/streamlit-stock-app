📈 Stock Price Prediction Web App using Machine Learning

A Streamlit-based web application that predicts stock prices using Machine Learning models, supporting both Indian and US stock markets.
The app allows users to visualize historical stock data, analyze trends, and generate future price predictions using past market behavior.

 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow applied to the stock market domain:

Data collection from real financial sources

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

ML model training and prediction

Interactive visualization using Streamlit

It is built primarily for learning, analysis, and portfolio demonstration purposes.
